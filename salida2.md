The color blue has always been associated with human perception and has not had any known physical causes or mechanisms. In fact, there are many other colors in nature besides blue that we use for various purposes. Blue was probably chosen as a color of particular value because it stands out from the rest of the visible spectrum, creating contrast and attracting our attention to its hue. It's not clear why the sky is blue or what factors contribute to this color, but we can enjoy it as a beautiful natural sight.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,797,17558,29892,727,29915,29879,694,2998,2769,2020,278,14744,881,367,7254,29889,450,2927,7254,756,2337,1063,6942,411,5199,17189,683,322,756,451,750,738,2998,9128,9946,470,13336,29879,29889,512,2114,29892,727,526,1784,916,11955,297,5469,18034,7254,393,591,671,363,5164,11976,29889,10924,471,3117,10434,408,263,2927,310,3153,995,1363,372,15028,714,515,278,1791,310,278,7962,18272,29892,4969,12814,322,13978,292,1749,21609,593,291,304,967,22888,29872,29889,739,29915,29879,451,2821,2020,278,14744,338,7254,470,825,13879,29126,304,445,2927,29892,541,591,508,13389,372,408,263,9560,5613,11126,29889],"total_duration":5327409295,"load_duration":7932479,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":22433000,"eval_count":122,"eval_duration":5249870000}
